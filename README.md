# SimpleChat

This is a basic Chat system written in Java 7 with JavaFX library for FAU OOP class. 

There is already a server instance running. 
Use 52.10.227.178 as the host and 75 as the port.

Or, if you want to run locally, you can run it locally

with java -jar RunServer.jar [port]



To run the application, run the MainApplication.java file 
or run the client.jar file. A window will appear 
telling you to type in a host and port. Use the host and port
above or localhost and the port you set if running locally.

Click connect. Then type in a username and click login.

This is better demonstrated with multiple users so I suggest using
the server instance and having multiple people connect to it at once.

To join a group, double click a group name on the right.
